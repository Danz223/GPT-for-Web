# GPT-for-Web
Create your own GPT-powered AI chat app UI for your website with pure HTML, CSS, JS.

You need to get your own OpenAI API key. FREE options üëá
If you want to get *free APIs*, check this GitHub Repo: https://github.com/xtekky/gpt4free

*Example:*
If you acquired your free API key from https://discord.pawan.krd , then change the following lines of code:

In chatbot.js, line 58: (apiURL) https://api.pawan.krd/v1/chat/completions
In chatbot.js, line 61: (apiKEY) pk-**************************** [the one you got from their discord]
In chatbot.js, line 65: (model) pai-001-light

If you are using the official OpenAI API key from openai.com, you need not change any part of the code. Just replace your API key in line 61 and deploy.

YOU MUST INCLUDE "Made with SpriFi" TEXT, LINKING TO "https://sprifi.weebly.com" JUST UNDER THE CHATBOT UI as credits.üôè
